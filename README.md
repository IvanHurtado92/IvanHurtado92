## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹  

Hi, I'm Ivan! I'm a 22-year-old software developer passionate about learning new programming languages and development tools.  

I have experience with several languages, including C++, C#, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also work with styling frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind, and I have experience using MySQL.  

Currently, I'm learning how to build RESTful APIs in C# using ASP.NET Core Web API.  

### Projects ðŸš€  

I've worked on various projects, including **SubHub**, a school project where we developed a mobile application that helps users track their subscriptions and get reminders for upcoming payments.

Additionally, my classmates and I are collaborating with our local **Red Cross** to develop a **patient management system**.
